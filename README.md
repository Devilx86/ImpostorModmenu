## Injecting Menu
- Compile the menu in android studio or download the release build.
- Install apktool version 2.4.1 (or you may have issues when compiling the apk back)
- Edit inject-apk.sh with path to amongus apk, the menu build and a keystore if you want the script to sign the build for you.
- run ./inject-apk.sh
- This will output an injected version of the game.

## Running the menu
- Install the apk
- Accept draw over app permission
- close app and clear task
- Tap the app icon 2 to 3 times, this is because its loading the base address of the game library.
- If all goes well, you should see the menu now.
